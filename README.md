# img-video-processor
Python application using cv2 library to detect faces and capture videos

In the face_detector.py file, if you change the image variable to read the photo.jpg, you can tweak the scaleFactor to 1.05, and 
if you use the news.jpg, use 1.1 to avoid detecting the man's hand as a face
